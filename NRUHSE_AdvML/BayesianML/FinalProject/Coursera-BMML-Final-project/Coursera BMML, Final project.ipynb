    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_composite.\">Facial composits</a> are widely used in forensics to generate images of suspects. Since victim or witness usually isn't good at drawing, computer-aided generation is applied to reconstruct the face attacker. One of the most commonly used techniques are evolutionary systems that compose the final face from many predefined parts.\n",

    "In this project we will try to implement an app for crating facial composite that will be able to construct desired faces without explicitly providing databases of templates. We will apply Variational Autoencoders and Gaussian processes for this task.\n",

    "Final project is developed in a way that you can apply learned techniques to real project yourself. We will include main guidelines and hints, but great part of the project will need your creativity and experience from previous assignments."

Because of this, we want to reconstruct the photo with the smallest possible number of trials."

To do so, we need to set up some scoring utility. Imagine that you want to generate an image of Brad Pitt. You start with a small number of random samples, say 5, and rank them according their similarity to your vision of Brad Pitt: 1 for the worst, 5 for the best. You then rate image by image using GPyOpt that works in a latent space of VAE. For the new image you need to somehow assign a real number that will show how good this image is.
